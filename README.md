# Building

## Automatic

This repo is part of an automated build, which is hosted on Docker Hub ( <https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/jakirkham/nanshe> ). Changes added to this trigger an automatic rebuild and deploy the resulting image to Docker Hub. To download an existing image, one simply needs to run `docker pull jakirkham/nanshe`.
